[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an infrastructure
as code tool that enables you to safely and predictably
provision and manage infrastructure in any cloud.

Developed by HashiCorp, this powerful tool uses the
HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to define and
provision a wide variety of cloud resources. Our team
extensively employs Terraform to manage cloud infrastructure
across various Cloud Service Providers, with a current focus
on Azure and AWS.

[Our
repositories](https://github.com/orgs/pagopa/repositories?q=infra),
located at [PagoPA GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/pagopa),
showcase the Terraform code we utilize. This approach allows
us to streamline our cloud operations, ensuring scalability
and reliability across our cloud platforms.
