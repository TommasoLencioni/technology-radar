[Runme](https://runme.dev/) turns your documentation (ie. READMEs) into interactive runbooks. It supports a variety of languages including JavaScript, TypeScript and Shell. It facilitates continuous integration by allowing you to test your runbooks and snippets against your app using the Runme CLI or GitHub Action. Additionally, it integrates with various task runners like Makefile, NPM/Pipfile Scripts, Rake, Gradle, Grunt/Gulp, etc., and works with pre-existing documentation, eliminating the need for extra infrastructure.

Use it when you want to automate your documentation and make it interactive.
